# Developing Applications with Draft

Draft makes it easier for developers to build applications that run on Kubernetes by doing two main things:

* The draft create command gives developers the artifacts they need to build and run their applications in Kubernetes
* The draft up command builds the container image for an application and deploys it to Kubernetes

Draft targets the "inner loop" of a developer's workflow: as they hack on code, but before code is committed to version control.

## Setup

To successfully walk through this demo, you'll need the following:

* Docker
* Visual Studio Code or your favorite editor
